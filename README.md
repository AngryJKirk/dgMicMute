dgMicMute
=========

This is a tool which allows you to mute your microphone in a convenient way.

Description
-----------

One day, a co-worker asked if someone knows a small tool, which allows him to mute his microphone, like he can mute the audio.
We were a little bit confused, because no one knows such a tool. However, most (if not all) Ultrabooks or Notebooks have a microphone equipped.
So I decided to write this little tool.

It resides in the notification area as a mircofone symbol (keep in mind to make it visible, it's normally hidden). With a simple right-click, you can (un-)mute your microphone.
It even has a *force-mode*, where it tries to prevent other applications from re-enabling the microphone (E.g. Skype does this. NSA might do it. :P).

A hotkey might be a nice to have, but still needs implementation.

Binaries
